### PWA Support
If you use Google Chrome, you can install Nekobito as a progressive web app.

### [Experimental] Save text in your local file
Nekobito is providing features to edit your local files. But it is experimental because Nekobito uses [File System Access API](https://wicg.github.io/file-system-access/) for it. You have to use the browser which supports the API to edit local files on Nekobito.
