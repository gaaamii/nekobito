**Warning: [The Datastore API](https://www.dropbox.com/developers-v1/datastore) has been deprecated.**

**You can read about this issue in detail [here](https://blogs.dropbox.com/developers/2015/04/deprecating-the-sync-and-datastore-apis/).**

**Nekobito is searching for an alternative, but can not ensure that your text data will be safe after Dropbox stops the API.**

### Save drafts on cloud
Nekobito uses [Dropbox Datastore API](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/datastore) as storage. By signing in with your Dropbox account, you can save drafts on cloud. Of course the text data is invisible for others because it's related to your account.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

```
Ctrl + n : Open new text
Ctrl + s : Save text
Ctrl + d : Delete text
Ctrl + l : Open sidebar
```

#### When sidebar is opened

```
k: up
j: down
o: open
```
